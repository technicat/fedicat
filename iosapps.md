# iOS Apps in the App Store

An overview of Mastodon apps I've found on the App Store, including first impressions of the free ones (one of these days I'll fork over a few dollars and try the rest), focusing on aspects that interest me and my design preferences. These apps have all been updated in the past year. Apps that seem to be no longer under development are in a [separate list](iosold.md).

## [Dawn](https://noppe.dev/dawn) by [@noppefoxwolf@mstdn.jp](https://mstdn.jp/@noppefoxwolf)

Paid on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/dawn-for-mastodon/id1668645019).

## [Dudu](http://dudu.today/)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%E5%98%9F%E5%98%9F%E9%95%BF%E6%AF%9B%E8%B1%A1/id1531987827). Flutter code on [github](https://github.com/duduapp/dudu).

Features: Clean look. Account switcher. Instance description displayed in login screen (although only a few pre-supplied instances).

Quirks: Limited timelines, no lists, primary language is Chinese (if you can read Chinese, check out the more detailed Chinese App Store [page](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E5%98%9F%E5%98%9F%E9%95%BF%E6%AF%9B%E8%B1%A1/id1531987827).

## [Feather](https://covelline.com/feather/mastodon/) by [@feather@covelline.social](https://covelline.social/@feather)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/sa/app/feather-for-mastodon/id6446263061) with google ads displayed at the bottom. Subscription required to remove ads and receive push notifications.

Features: Clean look. Tab bar editor.

Quirks: A bit rough, e.g. the tab bar displays my username under each icon.

## [Ice Cubes](https://mastodon.online/@IceCubesApp) by [@dimillian@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@dimillian)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp).

Articles on [Medium](https://dimillian.medium.com/the-making-of-ice-cubes-an-open-source-swiftui-mastodon-client-45ebea5cf6b6) and [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/ice_cubes_app_store_limbo).

Features: Excellent appearance (this and Ivory are the best looking of the bunch), full-width screen use for posts. Themes. Good hashtag completion. Most complete profile view, including links and featured hashtags. Very frequent updates. iPad-specific interface. Feed selection in top menu. Account switcher.

Quirks: Single-line entry field for alt-text entry. Avatar icons are rounded square (I feel they should be round for visual distinction). iPad columns are cramped.

## iMast

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imast/id1229461703)

Features: Allows login option between private or external browser.

Quirks: Square avatars with no rounded corners.

## [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) by [@tapbots@tapbots.social](https://tapbots.social/@tapbots)

Subscription on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ivory-for-mastodon-by-tapbots/id6444602274) required for anything beyond browsing.

Features: Latest followers avatar list in profile. Clear labeling of private mentions. Extracts description when used as a link share target (although the formatting in Metatext is better).  iPad-specific interface.

Quirks: Prompts if you really want to boost (unnecessary hindrance to boosting freely). Alt-text entry is not available when using as a share target for images. Profile tab is in the center instead of on the right as is conventional with social media apps.

## Ligt by [Revoo](https://revoo.studio/)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/ligt-for-mastodon/id1669105131) with premium subscriptions.

Features: autocomplete instance list with detailed descriptions and rules

## [Mammoth](https://getmammoth.app/) by [@mammoth@moth.social](https://moth.social/@mammoth)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mammoth-for-mastodon/id1667573899), planned subscription according to this review on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/mammoth-is-a-free-mastodon-app-for-ios-that-makes-it-easier-to-get-started/)

Features: A couple of built-in games, including chess. Fairly complete profile editing. Nice community (list of instances) browser (although missing universeodon.com). iPad-specific interface. Tab bar with top left menu selection of feeds including lists. Title area also has tabs selecting between feed and custom For You feed. Post translation. Quote posts. Android-style floating action button for posts. Fancy button animations.

Quirks: Shows up as a link share target but that just launches the app. Account switcher is buried inside Settings/Extras.

## [Manny](https://actuallyzach.com/manny) by [@TaylorLineman@mastodon.social](@mastodon.social/@TaylorLineman)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/manny-for-mastodon/id1668409667)

Features: Cute appearance, elaborate app icon. Good-looking and simple sign-on screen. Interesting use of gray-shaded background (and slightly rounded corners) for boosts. Top left menu selection of feeds including lists and followed tags. Supports switching among accounts (although adding an account is a bit glitchy, easy to accidentally duplicate, and not clear how to remove an account).

Quirks: Square avatars, account tab is not on far right, boost button has a non-obvous icon, uses "reblog" instead of "boost", non-boosted posts could use some more left side margin. Doesn't show up as a link share target. Replies icon doesn't show count (but likes and boosts do).

## [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/apps) by [@mastodon@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@Mastodon)

Official Mastodon app, free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon-ios)

Features: fairly complete profile editing, including adding links. I use this app whenever I want to edit my profile. Account switcher.

Quirks: uses "reblog" instead of "boost"

## [Mastoot](https://mastoot.app/) by [@libei@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@libei)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastoot/id1501485410).

Quirks: The profile tab on the far right is labeled ... which normally would bring you to another list of tab links. No list support.

## Mastweet

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/mastweet-for-mastodon-social/id6457201547) with in-app purchases.

Features: clean design.

Quirks: Not clear what features are enabled by in-app purchases. List support is not visible.

## [MetaText](https://metabolist.org/) by [@metabolist@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@metabolist)

Free on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metatext/id1523996615), Swift code on [Github](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext) (archived)

Features: Good alt-text entry interface with large multiline field that you can't ignore and offers a Detect Text (character recognition) feature. When sharing a link to this app it prepends an extracted description for the link, so I use this app as a share target for links and photos. Account switcher.

Quirks: No obvious indication in the feed that an image has alt-text, inconvenient path to profile (have to go through menu), doesn't display sensitive content warning. No longer actively maintained but [feditext](https://github.com/feditext/feditext) is a fork in progress.

## Mona by [@monaapp@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@monaapp)
